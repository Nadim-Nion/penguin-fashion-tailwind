# Penguin Fashion Website (Tailwind)

This is my first ever project using Tailwind. I haven't made it responsible as I have started learning it now. I have made the structure of the whole website using HTML. I have felt comfortable customizing the tailwind framework. There are a lot of utilities in this framework for customizing according to our requirements which are missing in Bootstrap. There is one limitation in this framework. We can't get the built-in features in this framework.
